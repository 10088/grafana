# Manage users as a Server Admin

This topic explains user management tasks performed by Grafana Server Admins.

In order to perform any of these tasks, you must be logged in to Grafana on an account with Grafana Server Admin permissions. For more information about Grafana Admin permissions, refer to [Grafana Server Admin role]({{< relref "../permissions/_index.md#grafana-server-admin-role" >}})

> **Note:** The Grafana Server Admin role does not exist in Grafana Cloud. Grafana Cloud users cannot perform tasks listed in this section.
