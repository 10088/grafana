## Order of Transformations

In case there are multipleÂ transformations, Grafana applies them in the exact sequence in which they are listed on the screen. Each transformation creates a new result set that is passed onto the next transformation in the pipeline for processing.

The order in which transformations are applied can make a huge difference in how your results look. For example, if you use a Reduce transformation to condense all the results of one column into a single value, then you can only apply transformations to that single value.
