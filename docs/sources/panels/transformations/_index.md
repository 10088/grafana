# Transformations

This topic explains in detail how to use the transformations feature in Grafana.

> **Note:** Transformations is a Grafana 7.0 beta feature. This topic will be frequently updated to reflect updates to the feature.

Transformations process the result set before itâ€™s passed to the visualization. They allow you to rename fields, join separate time series together, do math across queries, and more. For users, with numerous dashboards or with a large volume of queries, the ability to reuse the query result from one panel in another panel can be a huge performance gain.

> **Note:** Transformations sometimes result in data that cannot be graphed. When that happens, Grafana displays a suggestion on the visualization that you can click to switch to table visualization. This often helps you better understand what the transformation is doing to your data.

## Access

The transformations feature is accessible from the Transform tab of the Grafana panel editor.
